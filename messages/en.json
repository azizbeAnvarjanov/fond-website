The purpose of founding the clinic was to provide high-quality and modern medical care to patients. However, in the first period of the clinic's operation, the COVID-19 pandemic began, and it became a severe test for the whole world. Although the clinic was able to help many patients during the pandemic, unfortunately, due to lack of resources, it was not possible to help everyone.",

We studied advanced education systems abroad, including medical education and healthcare systems in European, Asian and American countries. In which countries medicine is taught at the highest level, how the best quality care is provided to patients, what kind of education system they have - we analyzed everything.",
    "text-5": "As a result of the studies, we decided to open a medical institute that conforms to the American USMLE system. In order to achieve this goal, we have engaged and learned from qualified specialists.",
    "text-6": "Finally, in 2022, as a result of our several years of efforts, the first and only private medical institute in Namangan region - Impulse Medicine, based on license No. The institute was opened.
